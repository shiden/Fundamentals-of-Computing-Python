# Compute a name tag, given the first and last name.

#Give the pre-defined variables first_name and last_name, 
#write an assignment statement that defines the variable 
#name_tag whose value is the string "My name is % %." 
#where the percents should be replaced by first_name and 
#last_name. Note that, in Python, you can use the + 
#operator on strings to concatenate (i.e. join) them 
#together into a single string.
