# Distance formula
# Student should enter statement on the next line.

# Hint: You need to use the power operation ** .

#The distance between two points (x0,y0) and (x1,y1) 
#is (x0−x1)2+(y0−y1)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√. 
#Write a Python statement that calculates and prints 
#the distance between the points (2,2) and (5,6).

# Expected output
# Student should look at the following comments and compare to printed output.

#5.0
((2 - 5) ** 2 + (2 - 6) ** 2) ** 0.5

sqrt  = 0.5** ( 2 - 5 ) ** 2 + ( 2 - 6 ) ** 2
print sqrt
